User story;

 When I click plus button on product's row, I can increase the product's quantity.

 When I click minus button on product's row, I can decrease the product's quantity, but minimum quantity value can be 1.

 When I click remove button on product's row or I decrease the quantity to 0, I can delete a product in the cart.
